# Quickstart: Singel Node Deployment Guide

## Environment Preparation
1. Purchase a machine equipped with GPU and install GPU drivers simultaneously
2. Connect remotely to the GPU instance and access the machine terminal
3. Install Docker environment and NVIDIA Container Toolkit
```shell
curl -fsSL https://github.com/alibaba/ROLL/blob/main/scripts/install_docker_nvidia_container_toolkit.sh  | sudo bash   
```

## Environment Configuration
Choose your desired image from the [image addresses](https://alibaba.github.io/ROLL/docs/English/QuickStart/image_address). The following example will use *torch2.6.0 + vLLM0.8.4*.
```shell
# 1. Start a Docker container with GPU support, expose the port, and keep the container running.
sudo docker run -dit \
  --gpus all \
  -p 9001:22 \
  --ipc=host \
  --shm-size=10gb \
  roll-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/roll/pytorch:nvcr-24.05-py3-torch260-vllm084 \
  /bin/bash

# 2. Enter the Docker container
#    You can find your running container's ID or name using `sudo docker ps`.
sudo docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash

# 3. Verify GPU visibility
nvidia-smi

# 4. Clone the project repo
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/ROLL.git

# 5. Install dependencies (select the requirements file corresponding to your chosen image)
cd ROLL
pip install -r requirements_torch260_vllm.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
```

## Pipeline Execution
```shell
bash examples/agentic_demo/run_agentic_pipeline_frozen_lake_single_node_demo.sh  
```
